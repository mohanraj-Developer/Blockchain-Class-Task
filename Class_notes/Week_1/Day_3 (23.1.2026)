3️.Blockchain Transaction Process
Person A (Sender)
        |
        | 1. Transaction Created
        |    (Amount + Receiver Address
        |     + Digital Signature)
        ↓
Transaction Broadcast
to Peer-to-Peer Network
        ↓
Nodes Verify Transaction
(Signature, Balance,
 Double Spending)
        ↓
Valid Transactions
(Mempool / Pending Pool)
        ↓
Miners Select Transactions
        ↓
Block Creation
(Transaction + Previous
 Block Hash + Merkle Root)
        ↓
Proof of Work
(Cryptographic Puzzle
 + Nonce Finding)
        ↓
New Block Found
        ↓
Block Broadcast to All Nodes
        ↓
Nodes Verify Block
        ↓
Block Added to Blockchain
        ↓
Transaction Confirmed
        ↓
Person B (Receiver)
Definition
A blockchain transaction is a process where crypto is transferred from one wallet to another and verified by the network.
Key Points
•	Transaction is requested
•	Goes to pending pool
•	Verified by nodes
•	Added into a block
•	Block is broadcast to all nodes
•	Stored permanently on blockchain
________________________________________
4️.Block in Blockchain
Definition
A block is a container that stores a group of verified transactions.
Key Points
•	Bitcoin block size: 1 MB
•	Each block is linked to the previous block
•	Contains:
o	Transaction data
o	Previous block hash
o	Nonce
•	Shared with every node in the network
________________________________________
5️. Nodes and Miners
Node
A node is a computer that maintains and verifies blockchain data.
Miner
A miner verifies transactions and creates new blocks.
Key Points
•	Nodes ensure decentralization
•	Miners solve cryptographic puzzles
•	Miners receive rewards in cryptocurrency
________________________________________
6️. Nonce
Definition
A nonce is a random number used in mining to solve cryptographic puzzles.
Key Points
•	Changes for every mining attempt
•	Helps generate a valid block hash
•	If input changes → hash changes
________________________________________
7️. Consensus Mechanism
Definition
A consensus mechanism is a method used to agree on the validity of transactions in a blockchain network.
Types & Key Points
🔹 Proof of Work (PoW)
•	Used in Bitcoin
•	Requires heavy computation
•	24/7 mining
•	High energy consumption
🔹 Proof of Stake (PoS)
•	Based on token staking
•	Less energy consumption
•	Faster than PoW
🔹 Proof of Authority (PoA)
•	Based on trusted validators
🔹 Proof of Learning (PoL)
•	Based on learning models
🔹 Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
•	Validators elected by token holders
________________________________________
8️.Bitcoin Halving
Definition
Bitcoin halving is an event where the mining reward is reduced by half every 4 years.
Key Points
•	Controls Bitcoin supply
•	Often leads to bull runs
•	Halving history:
o	2008 → 50 BTC
o	2012 → 25 BTC
o	2016 → 12.5 BTC
o	2020 → 6.25 BTC
o	2024 → 3.125 BTC

9️. NFT (Non-Fungible Token)
Definition
An NFT is a unique digital asset that cannot be replaced or duplicated.
Key Points
•	Non-fungible = not interchangeable
•	Represents ownership
•	Examples:
o	Digital art
o	Photos
o	Videos
o	Digital signatures
•	Built on blockchain
•	Each NFT is unique
________________________________________
10.Fungible Token
Definition
A fungible token is a digital asset where each unit has the same value.
Key Points
•	Interchangeable
•	Examples:
o	INR
o	Dollar
o	Bitcoin
