1. Cryptography:
Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain security. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data.
Types of Cryptography
1.1 Symmetric Cryptography
•	Same key is used for encryption and decryption
•	Faster in execution
•	Key sharing is risky
1.2 Asymmetric Cryptography
•	Uses a Public Key and a Private Key
•	More secure than symmetric cryptography
•	Widely used in blockchain systems
________________________________________
2. Blockchain Overview
Blockchain is a distributed and immutable ledger system used to record transactions securely.
Core Components of Blockchain
•	Cryptography → Security and immutability
•	Consensus → Agreement among network nodes
•	Distributed Ledger → Shared and synchronized data
________________________________________
3. Role of Cryptography in Blockchain
Cryptography is used in blockchain to provide:
1.	Data Integrity – Ensures data is not altered
2.	Transaction Security – Protects transactions from tampering
3.	Decentralized Identity – Ownership is proven using cryptographic keys instead of usernames and passwords
________________________________________
4. Hashing
Hashing is a cryptographic process that converts input data of any size into a fixed-length output.
Key Characteristics of Hash Functions
•	Fixed-length output (e.g., SHA-256 → 64 hexadecimal characters)
•	Output contains alphanumeric characters (0–9, a–f)
Properties of Hash Functions
1.	Deterministic – Same input always produces the same hash
2.	One-Way Function – Original data cannot be derived from the hash
3.	Avalanche Effect – Small input change causes a large change in output
4.	Collision Resistance – Two different inputs should not generate the same hash
Hashing in Blockchain
•	Ensures security and immutability
•	Detects data tampering
•	Links blocks together

5. Usage of Hashing in Blockchain
Hashing is used in blockchain for:
1.	Linking blocks using the previous block hash
2.	Detecting tampering in stored data
3.	Creating a unique fingerprint for each transaction

6. Public Key & Private Key Cryptography
Wallet Structure
Private Key → Public Key → Wallet Address
A blockchain wallet is used to store cryptographic keys, send and receive cryptocurrency, and sign transactions.
It does not store cryptocurrency directly, but controls access to blockchain assets.
________________________________________

6.1 Private Key
•	Secret key of the user
•	Provides full control over funds
•	Used to sign transactions
•	Automatically generated and can be backed up using a seed phrase
Loss of private key = permanent loss of funds
One who holds the private key controls the assets.
________________________________________
6.2 Public Key
•	Generated from the private key
•	Used to verify digital signatures
•	Can be shared publicly
________________________________________
6.3 Wallet Address
•	Generated from the public key
•	Used to receive cryptocurrency
•	Visible on the blockchain
Example:
0x8f47990b7bd0cb26883e5311aa80e11ed83017808
________________________________________
6.4 How Wallet Works (Simple Flow)
1.	User creates a transaction
2.	Transaction is signed using the private key
3.	Network verifies the signature
4.	Transaction is added to the blockchain
 
________________________________________
6.5 Importance of Wallet
•	Ensures secure ownership
•	Prevents unauthorized access
•	Supports decentralization
Wallet Summary
Wallet = Tool to manage cryptographic keys and access blockchain assets
________________________________________
7. Digital Signature
Digital signatures ensure:
•	Proof of sender identity
•	Integrity of transaction data
Digital Signature Process
1.	Transaction is created
2.	Signed using the private key
3.	Verified using the public key
________________________________________
8. Merkle Tree
What is a Merkle Tree?
A Merkle Tree is a tree-like data structure of hashes used to summarize and verify large amounts of data efficiently.
Merkle Root
•	Single hash representing all transactions in a block
•	Stored in the block header
•	Any change in transaction data changes the Merkle root
Why Merkle Tree is Needed
1.	Fast transaction verification
2.	Reduced data transfer
3.	Strong tamper resistance
________________________________________
9. Merkle Proof
Merkle Proof is a path of hashes used to verify that a transaction belongs to a block without downloading the entire block.
________________________________________
10. Transactions & Merkle Tree Example
•	Transactions: Tx1, Tx2, Tx3, Tx4
•	Transactions are paired and hashed
•	Final hash becomes the Merkle Root
Any modification in a transaction propagates to the root hash.

11. Bitcoin vs Ethereum (Merkle Structure)
Feature	Bitcoin	Ethereum
Merkle Structure Used	Merkle Tree	Modified Merkle Patricia Tree
Purpose	Transaction verification	Transaction and state management
Data Stored	Transaction data only	Transactions, Receipts, Account State
Merkle Root	Stored in block header	Multiple roots stored in block header
Number of Trees	One	Three
Trees Included	Transaction Merkle Tree	Transaction Trie, Receipt Trie, State Trie
Light Client Support	SPV wallets	Ethereum light clients (not classic SPV)
Smart Contract Support	No	Yes
Complexity	Simple	Complex but powerful

12. Ethereum Gas Fees
Gas fees are the charges paid to execute transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
What is Gas?
•	Unit that measures computational work
•	Every operation requires gas
•	Higher computation = higher gas
Gas Fee Formula
Gas Fee = Gas Used × Gas Price
Gas Price
•	Measured in Gwei
•	1 Ether = 1,000,000,000 Gwei
•	Higher gas price results in faster confirmation
Why Gas Fees Are Needed
•	Prevent spam attacks
•	Reward validators
•	Control network congestion
Reasons for High Gas Fees
•	Network congestion
•	High transaction demand
•	Complex smart contracts

Gas Fees and Layer-2
•	Ethereum uses Layer-2 solutions (Rollups)
•	Reduces gas cost
•	Improves scalability
