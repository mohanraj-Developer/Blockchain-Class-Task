Blockchain Security, Network & Mining

Double Spending Problem
Double spending means spending the same Bitcoin in more than one transaction.
Example:
Sending the same Bitcoin to two different persons at the same time.

Preventing Double Spending
Group of transactions is time-stamped
Transaction details are sent to all or many nodes in the network
Blockchain is constantly growing & each block prevents double spending
Blockchain ensures that any modification in block will lead to recomputing of following blocks
Anyone can validate transaction & prevent double spending

Bitcoin Attacks
Bitcoin network is vulnerable to cyber attacks and fraud, providing tamper-proof ledger of transactions.
People with malicious intent can exploit known vulnerabilities in blockchain technology and have been successful in several hacks and frauds over years.

Hackers and Fraudsters Threaten Blockchain in 4 Primary Ways
Phishing
Sybil attack
Routing
51% attack


Sybil Attack
Hacker creates and uses many fake network identities to flood network and crash the system.
Sybil refers to famous book character diagnosed with multiple identity disorder.

Types of Sybil Attacks
1. Direct Attack
Sybil node directly influences honest node
 		Sybil node → Honest node
2. Indirect Attack
Sybil node influences middle node which in turn influences honest node
 		Sybil node → Middle node → Honest node

Why Sybil Attack is Done
To take control of network and allow malicious blocks & transactions
To prevent transactions from being confirmed
To reverse transactions
To perform double spending

Prevent Sybil Attack
Proof of Work consensus algorithm is used to prevent Sybil attack on Bitcoin
Many miners exist across different geographical regions
Transactions are verified by every node and rejected as invalid if faulty transaction are included in block

Node: System + Blockchain software server
Phishing
Phishing is scamming attempt to attain user’s credentials.
Fraudster sends email to wallet key access that appears to come from legitimate source
Email asks users for their credentials using fake hyperlinks

Crypto Phishing
Cyber criminals try to steal cryptocurrency from owners.
Cyber criminals act as providers (exchange, wallet and soon) and send phishing emails.

Different Ways of Crypto Phishing
Google Ad word phishing
Chat phishing
Message phishing
Social media phishing
Email phishing

Routing Attack
Blockchain rely on real time large data transfers. Hackers can intercept data while it is being transferred to internet service providers.
In routing attack, blockchain participant typically can’t see threat, so everything looks normal
However, behind scene fraudsters have extracted confidential data or transactions

Impact of Routing Attack
Eg: Bitcoin where miners solve puzzle to create new block & send that block to network for confirmation.
Imagine attacker does not allow block to reach Blockchain and delays it until another miner solves same block and gets reward. The actual miner however does not get any reward.
Delaying time to solve puzzle
BGP: Border Gateway Protocol is glue that holds internet together by disseminating information about how to reach destination in remote network. (Individual)  
ASes: Internet is made up of approximately 67,000 autonomous systems. Each with its own AS number (ASN) and set of IP prefixes. (Group)
Another problem arises when 50% of Bitcoin nodes are concentrated in 3 countries only and it is difficult to imagine China alone has around 80% of Bitcoin mining pool in world.
According to research, 60% of Bitcoin connections use only 3 ASes & if an attacker hacks these 3 ASes they can disrupt Bitcoin network.

51% Attack Points
Mining especially for large scale public blockchain requires a significant amount of computing power
If miner / group of miners could rally enough resources they could attain more than 50% of blockchain mining power
Having more than 50% of power means having control over ledger and ability to manipulate it
Private blockchains are not vulnerable to 51% attack.









Bitcoin Networks
Bitcoin is an ad-hoc network with mesh topology
Protocol runs on TCP 8333.  [TCP – Transmission Control Protocol]
All the nodes are treated equally in Bitcoin network
New node can join network anytime and non-responsive nodes are removed after 3hrs

Two Types of Bitcoin Networks
1. Main Network - Actual network on which all cryptocurrency exchange and transactions are conducted
2. Test Network - Network that mimics behaviour of main network and is used to test new applications and scripts

Bitcoin Nodes
1. Full Node
Implementation of Bitcoin core client Performing wallet, memory, blockchain storage Network routing function
2. Light Node
Capable of only wallet and networking routing functionality

Joining Bitcoin Network
Steps performed to join Bitcoin network as an active node (miner):
Requesting seed node → Retrieving Address list → Selecting peer node → Updating network
Step 1: Requesting Seed Node
There are certain special nodes in Bitcoin network called seed nodes that have a list of all active full nodes. New joining nodes ask for list of addresses from seed node.
Step 2: Retrieving Address List
Seed node sends them addresses in response to node request to join network.

Step 3: Selecting Peer Node
Joining node selects address from list & requests to join network.
Step 4: Updating Network
A newly joined node gets most recent copy of blockchain peers.

Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by solving complex mathematical problems.
Verify the legitimacy of transaction
Include the verified transaction in block
PoW consensus among all the active nodes generates valid nonce
A new block is added to chain once consensus is achieved

Mining:
Mining:  Limited supply ↓
Demand ↑  Price ↑
Eg: Gold
Block reward is high for  blocks Halving
