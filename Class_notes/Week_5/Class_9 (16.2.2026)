                               ETHEREUM

1. Introduction to Ethereum
• Founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin.
• A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts.
• Native cryptocurrency: Ether (ETH).
• Key Components: Smart Contracts, Gas, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
• Supports Decentralized Applications (DApps).
2. Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)
• Formed in 2017.
• Consortium of technology companies, financial institutions, startups, and academics.
• Promotes Ethereum technology for enterprise use.
• Focus: Private networks, security, interoperability, and standard guidelines.
• Members include companies like Accenture, Intel, Microsoft, and JP Morgan.
• Industry sectors: Healthcare, Energy, Technology, Banking.
3. Smart Contracts
• Self-executing programs stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
• Written in languages like Solidity.
• Compiled into bytecode and executed by the EVM.
• Used for decentralized finance (DeFi), tokens, agreements, and DApps.
• Automatically execute when predefined conditions are met.
4. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
• Runtime environment for executing smart contracts.
• Stack-based architecture (LIFO).
• Stack size: 1024 elements, each 256 bits (32 bytes).
• Ensures deterministic execution across the network.
5. Ether 
Ether is the primary digital asset or cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform.
It is a transactional token that facilitates the operation of ethereum.
All Gas prices are paid in Ethers.
                             BITCOIN	                              ETHER
1.Uses Secure hash algorithm(SHA-256)	1.Uses Ethash algorithm
2.Used as currency for purchasing goods and services	2.Used as currency for making decentralized Apps(DApps)
3.Digital currency to compete against FIAT currencies and Gold	3.Mainly used for Smart Contracts
4.Slow Transaction speed	4.Fast Transaction speed

5.Very high mining price
	5.Low gas price comparatively
6. Gas and Gas Price
• Gas measures computational effort required to execute operations.
• Gas fee = Gas Limit × Gas Price.
• Paid in Ether.
• Prevents network spam and infinite loops.
7. Ethereum Accounts
• Two types of accounts:
   1. Externally Owned Account (EOA) – Controlled by private key, can send transactions.
   2. Contract Account – Controlled by smart contract code.
• EOAs cannot create contracts directly without sending transactions.
• Contract accounts execute code automatically.
8. Ethereum Mining (PoW Concept)
• Process of validating transactions and adding blocks to blockchain.
• Previously used Proof of Work (PoW).
• Miners received block rewards and transaction fees.
• Uncle blocks: Valid but not included in main chain; rewarded partially.
9. DAO
• Internet-based organization governed by smart contracts.
• Decisions made by community voting.
• No centralized authority.
• Transparent and secure governance mechanism.
10. Swarm
• Decentralized storage and content distribution service for Ethereum.
• Uses chunking and Merkle trees.
• Stores DApp code and blockchain-related data.
• Peer-to-peer data sharing network.
11. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
• Decentralized file storage system.
• Uses content addressing (CID).
• Enables distributed global namespace.
• Often integrated with Ethereum DApps.
12. BitTorrent
• Peer-to-peer file sharing protocol.
• Uses torrent files and trackers.
• Efficient distribution of large files across network.
13. Whisper (Decentralized Messaging)
• Identity-based messaging protocol.
• Provides encrypted peer-to-peer communication.
• Low-level API for decentralized communication.
• Designed to prevent tracking and ensure privacy.
